The following are descriptions of python scripts and .txt files associated with all things high altitude balloons.

---------------- Balloon.py -------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:

- "import balloon" on any script that uses one of these functions.

FUNCTIONS:

	- Function to get aprs data. 
	- Returns dictionary with lots of info from the aprs packet
	- "callsign" and "APRS_apikey" are strings

	- Function to send a slack message
	- Inputs are:
		- messageString (string)
		- 'dm' for direct message, 'channel' for channel
		- recipient - name of person like 'Robby', or channel like '#predictions'
		- slackURL - url for sending messages to this slack account. Available in settings.

- package(dataset,prediction_ID, flightID)

	- Input is prediction number (string) 
	- Returns new variable (dict) 

- allPredictions = unpackageGroup(flightID,numPredictions)
	- Function to read in multiple saved variables.
	- Input is flightID (str) and number of predictions (int)
	- Returns dictionary filled with prediction elements

- launchLoc = launchPrediction(payload,balloon,parachute,helium,lat,lon,launchTime,tolerance)

	..['Landing Devaiations']	- Dataframe with final landing locations of non-nominal ensembles. Columns of:
						- 'Lat'
						- 'Lon'
					- Number of elements = number of ensembles. 
	..['Secondary Tracks']	- Dictionary.

---------------- StationList.txt -------------------------------------
- Contains a list of weather stations
- Does not need to be altered.

---------------- StationListWorld.txt -------------------------------------
- Contains a list of weather stations
- Does not need to be altered.

---------------- PreFlightAnalysis.py -------------------------------------
- under development 
- Does a prediction backwards to find best launch location for a desired landing location, animates the result, and does a checksum by doing prediction forwards from given launch location

---------------- PostFlightAnalysis.py -------------------------------------
- under development 
- can be used for a variety of purposes

---------------- TrackingCode(APRS).py -------------------------------------
- Main commanding script used to track and record data for a single flight, if APRS trackers are being used.
- Notifications are sent via slack 
	- initially after launch
	- immediatly before landing
	- during flight if the predicted landing coordinates shift more than a set threshold from the last slack notification. 
- All data is saved from all predictions.
	- Data is saved iteratively to prevent data loss associated with program failure. 
- Able to send warnings via slack if tracker preformance or gps reception is not nominal. 
- Able to self-diagnose code errors and attempt to solve them in order to keep tracking.
